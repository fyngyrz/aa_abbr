# README.md

Github doesn't display `<abbr>` tags properly. It also doesn't display HTML files properly without some
fiddling, which I have performed for you below. Because Github's markdown processor doesn't handle `<abbr>`
tags, I've prepared a proper readme in HTML. Follow the link below to see the actual readme as the good lard (that would be me)
intended. I suggest you open it with a right-click and select "open in new tab", because the `target="_blank"`
HTML attribute doesn't work on Github either, sigh.
